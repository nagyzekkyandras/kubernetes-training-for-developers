OpenShift is a family of containerization software products developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform â€” a hybrid cloud platform as a service built around Linux containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Both Kubernetes and OpenShift feature robust and scalable architecture that enables rapid and large-scale application development, deployment, and management. Openshift provide a web interface, security options, build in docker image registry, template engine and minimal CI solution out of the box.

### Template engine
- yaml based
- predefined app and template catalog
- save your own template for later in the app catalog

### Build Config
- The build-in CI solution
    - git repository with dockerfile
    - predefined dockerfile
